For my extension I decided to implement code generation for the C-for loops
Sadly I could not find caused them to malfunction in the previous lab (lab3)

# Test design

Tests in `exprs` try as many cases as possible for boolean and arithmetic expressions
Tests in `control` are for branching, loops, ...
I didn't do any particular cases for tests on allocation because I don't see what I could add. All the things I could think of are already tested.

# Design choices

I used `1 - b` to implement the boolean not because it is simple and there is no single instruction to do it.

For the all-in-mem allocation, I went for the simplest allocation as possible.
An instruction takes 3 parameters or fewer. So I just use them in order.
The first parameter goes in S[1], the second in S[2] and the third in S[3]

# Known bugs

None for now

# Checklists

and *tested* with appropriate test cases.
